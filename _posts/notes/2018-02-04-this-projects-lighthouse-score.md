The scores for this project are: **Performance:** 98 / **PWA:** 91 / **Accessibility:** 100 / **Best Practices:** 100 / **SEO:** 100

When I ran this through Google Lighthouse I knew there would be two things that would cause the score to drop: the site doesn't automatically re-direct to `https` and render blocking scripts.

The first happens because I'm using a sub-domain for the test site. If it runs under a custom domain this will be fixed. It's the same deal when hosting on GitHub pages - you can access your site over `https` but traffic directed to `http` won't automatically re-direct.

The second happens because of the Netlify identiy widget that's used to access Netlify's CMS. I don't know how to get around this one yet.
